Post Your Ideas As You Get Them:

First Idea: Implement one of those memory flash card games where you have a limited number of attempts to match all of the cards in pairs of two.  The user can customize the card designs (just change the pictures and card backs) and their fastest time is recorded as a score.  They could also maybe change other parts of the game like how many cards match and the total amount of cards.
